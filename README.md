This program is a website, all code was authored by myself, and all installs should be on the remote site.

Integrated Reporting frameworks are used so that companies, and stakeholders can look at how financially represented values within a company change. For this project I wanted to create a web application that simulates these frameworks. The result is a application that takes input of assets and then represents them in a table and pi chart. To do this I used the following programming languages: C++, Python, PHP, and HTML with CSS.

Future Work:
Some future plans for improvement on this project include linking a database for extended useful lifespan. I also want to create more visuals, probably not in python as the application is already quite slow.
