# Integrated Reporting Frameworks Website

Integrated Reporting frameworks are used so that companies, and stakeholders can look at how financially represented values within a company change. For this project I wanted to create a web application that simulates these frameworks. The result is a application that takes input of assets and then represents them in a table and pi chart. To do this I used the following programming languages: C++, Python, PHP, and HTML with CSS.

Future Work:
Some future plans for improvement on this project include linking a database for extended useful lifespan. I also want to create more visuals, probably not in python as the application is already quite slow.
